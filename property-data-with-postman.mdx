title: Property Data with Postman
---
For this guide, we're going to assume you're interested in using Datafiniti's property data to do some marketing analysis on homes in the US.  Let's say you're a data scientist that's been tasked with the following:

1\. Collect data on homes.

2\. Sort the data by state.

3\. Find which states have the most expensive homes.

**Your environment and data needs:**

1\. You're working with Postman.

2\. You want to work with CSV or JSON data.

Here are the steps we'll take:

\## 1. Download Postman

We recommend using Postman when accessing the Datafiniti API.  It's a great client for using any sort of RESTful API and works particularly well with Datafiniti.  You can download Postman \[here]\([<a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.postman.com/downloads/</a>](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)).

\## 2. Get your API token

The next thing you'll need is your API token.  The API token lets you authenticate with Datafiniti API and tells it who you are, what you have access to, and so on.  Without it, you can't use the API.

To get your API token, go the \[Datafiniti Web Portal ([<a href="https://portal.datafiniti.co)](https://portal.datafiniti.co/settings/api)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://portal.datafiniti.co)\](https://portal.datafiniti.co/settings/api</a>](https://portal.datafiniti.co\)]\(https://portal.datafiniti.co/settings/api)<a href="https://portal.datafiniti.co)](https://portal.datafiniti.co/settings/api)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">)</a>, login, and click your settings in the left navigation bar.  From there, you'll see a page showing your token.  Your API token will be a long string of letters and numbers.  Copy the API token or store it somewhere you can easily reference.
